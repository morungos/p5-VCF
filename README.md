### VCF.pm

A repackaged version of the core Vcf.pm from vcftools (see: https://github.com/vcftools/vcftools).

I've done this as vcftools is distributed from Sourceforge and doesn't have a
CPAN version, so it can't be a dependency for other CPAN-based components. This makes deployment very much more awkward.
